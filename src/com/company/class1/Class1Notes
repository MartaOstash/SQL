======================
Database:
A program that helps us to store and manipulate data(all the text,
figures,images that we add to out app).

What SQL:
SQL is structured query language that we use to manipulate data
inside our databases.
SQL is similar to Java and SQL workbench is similar to IntelliJ.
SQL is a language that is used to communicate with our database.

==================================================================
Our apps consist of frontend, backend and database
They are independent to each other.
As a SW Automation Engineer Tester we need to test our backend and
databases as well.

Why do we need Database?
In Excel we do not have control over the individual columns
or fields and they cannot handle large amount of data.

Database can handle very large amount of data.
We can have control over individual columns, rows and the tables.
We may allow some of the user to see only certain tables columns
and rows.
Database are very secure as compare to excel files or any other
files.

/(Primary key - the unique key
Foreign key - the primary key from a diff page that is referring to it.
All of the tables in relational database are connected.)/

DataBases will contain tables and inside the tables we will have special
column called primaryKey that will contain unique numbers/text to identify
all of the rows uniquely inside that table.
These columns in the tase table are called primary keys and when referred in
other tables they're called  foreign keys.


Commands to retrieve data:
1st line -please use this database in this query;
SELECT all from this this table  SELECT * FROM hs_hr_employees;---name;
---will return all the rows and columns from the table;

Why SQL what is SQL?
It's a structured query language that helps us to store and manipulate data.

# sorts the data in ascending order
SELECT * FROM Customers order by CustomerName asc;

#sorts the data in asc order based on multiple columns
SELECT * FROM Customers order by CustomerName asc;

IN case of the OR any of teh criteria should be met;
IN the case of AND - ALL the criteria should be true;

#contains ol written together no matter how many char are before/after them
   SELECT * FROM hs_hr_employees where emp_firstname like '%ol%'


 #starts from these letters
    SELECT * FROM hs_hr_employees where emp_firstname like 'mar%' ;

 #ends with these letters
     SELECT * FROM hs_hr_employees where emp_firstname like '%mar' ;

     #return all the rows for which i don't care about the first 5 numbers,
     and  last 3 but there should be 02(the data format is 1111-11-11)
     SELECT * FROM hs_hr_employees where emp_birthday like '____02___' ;
